# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Data Science Galaxy

is a mural board I started to organize many data science techniques, processes, and concepts into some logical form. 

This is perpetually unfinished. It is updated irregularly.   

To read or use this tool, start in the center. I conceptualize all tasks along five paths (or abstract objectives):
+ Predict 
+ Infer
+ Detect
+ Optimize
+ Describe

Follow the path outward for specificity and instructions for implementation. :hammer:
